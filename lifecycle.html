  <h2>1) Introduction</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>There's more to building a house than nailing boards together
    <ul>
    <li>Have to make sure the pipes are put in before the drywall goes up</li>
    <li>Satisfy building code regulations</li>
    <li>Make sure everyone on the team is productive (not just busy)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This lecture covers the equivalent topics for small-team software development
    <ul>
    <li>12x12: up to a dozen people, working for up to a year</li>
    <li>All of these ideas apply to people working on their own for two weeks or more</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="topic">
  <h2>2) You Can Skip This Lecture If...</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>You don't care if anyone else can ever use your software</li>
  <li>You enjoy being frustrated and unproductive</li>
  <li>You're sure that people you've never met will be able to use and modify your software two years from now</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Sturdy vs. Agile</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Two camps currently dominate the debate about software development</li>
  <li>Sturdy: measure twice, cut once
    <ul>
    <li>Think through users' needs, design, and possible problems before starting to code</li>
    <li>Inspired by traditional engineering (in which late changes are very expensive)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Agile: lots of small steps, with continuous testing and refactoring
    <ul>
    <li>&quot;No battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy.&quot; (Helmuth von Moltke)</li>
    <li>They refer to the sturdy camp (disparagingly) as <a href="{{root_path}}/book/glossary.html#bduf" target="glo:bduf">Big Design Up Front</a> (BDUF)</li>
    <li>Inspired by open source and 1990s web development</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Differences in practice are much less than the differences in rhetoric</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Boehm's Curve</h2>

  <ul>
  <li>Sturdy: aim carefully so that problems don't arise
    <ul>
    <li>The cheapest bug to fix is one that doesn't exist</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Agile: continuously correct course

  <h2>5) Which One Is Better for Scientists?</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Customers and funding agencies are (understandably) reluctant to fund &quot;we'll make it up as we go along&quot;
    <ul>
    <li>But on the other hand, this is a good description of research</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Factors affecting choice:
    <ul>
    <li>How well the team understands the problem domain, tools, etc.</li>
    <li>How stable the goals are</li>
    <li>How many people are involved</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you don't know enough to make long-term predictions with confidence, use agile
    <ul>
    <li>This means every genuinely new project ought to start agile</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If hundreds of people are involved, frequent course corrections will be painful
    <ul>
    <li>Though many agile advocates disagree</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <h2>6) Vision</h2>
  <ul>

  <h2>8) Agile Development</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Start with agile because it's a closer fit to conventional research practices</li>
  <li>Arose in the 1990s to cope with:
    <ul>
    <li>Ever-changing requirements
      <ul>
      <li>Six-month iterations were longer than the lifespan of the average dot-com</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Internet time
      <ul>
      <li>Web-based delivery makes it possible to &quot;ship&quot; a new version whenever you want</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Based on very short development cycles (a minutes to a month, but no longer)
    <ul>
    <li>Because that's as far out as most people can reliably predict effort or needs</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>9) Extreme Programming</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Best known form of agile in the early days was <a href="{{root_path}}/book/glossary.html#extreme-programming" target="glo:extreme-programming">Extreme Programming</a> (XP)</li>
  <li>Took all the key ideas of agile to the limit:
    <ul>
    <li>Stand-up meeting at the start of every day</li>
    <li>Customer always available for consultation</li>
    <li><a href="{{root_path}}/book/glossary.html#test-driven-development" target="glo:test-driven-development">Test-driven development</a></li>

      <ul>
      <li>Two people at each workstation</li>
      <li>One typing, the other reviewing (and learning) in real time</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Constant <a href="{{root_path}}/book/glossary.html#refactor" target="glo:refactor">refactoring</a></li>
    <li>No functionality is added until it's needed
      <ul>
      <li><a href="{{root_path}}/book/glossary.html#yagni" target="glo:yagni">You Ain't Gonna Need It</a> (YAGNI)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Development cycle:
    <ul>
    <li>Choose the next small feature to add
      <ul>
      <li>More properly &quot;micro-feature&quot;</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Write some tests to make sure it's working
      <ul>
      <li>Yes, these are supposed to fail</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Write enough code to make all tests pass
      <ul>
      <li>Not just the newly-created tests</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Refactor</li>
    <li>Check in to version control</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pitfalls:
    <ul>
    <li>Customer often <em>isn't</em> always available</li>
    <li>Many people prefer not to pair program
      <ul>
      <li>Except when faced with a hard bug, or when bringing a new team member up to speed</li>
      </ul>

  <h2>12) Scrum Key Practices</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Sprint planning meeting held at the beginning of each iteration
    <ul>
    <li>Analyze and prioritize current product backlog</li>
    <li>Select overall goal for sprint</li>
    <li>Decide how to achieve the goal (design)</li>
    <li>Create a sprint backlog from the product backlog (more about this below)</li>
    <li>Estimate backlog in hours
      <ul>
      <li>Nothing should be longer than a couple of working days</li>
      <li>Anything that is should be broken into smaller testable/deliverable chunks</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Daily scrum meeting
    <ul>
    <li>Every morning, 15 minutes long, standing up (to make sure it stays 15 minutes long)</li>
    <li>Everyone says:
      <ul>
      <li>What they did yesterday</li>
      <li>What they are going to do today</li>
      <li>What stands in their way</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><em>Not</em> a status update, but rather making commitments to colleagues</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sprint review held at the end of the iteration
    <ul>
    <li>Team presents what it accomplished
      <ul>
      <li>Demo, not slides</li>
      <li>And yes, everything <em>can</em> be demo'd</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sprint retrospective also held at the end of the iteration
    <ul>
    <li>What do we want to start doing?</li>
    <li>What do we want to stop doing?</li>
    <li>What do we want to keep doing?</li>

  <h2>13) Scrum Artifacts</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Product backlog
    <ul>
    <li>A list of all the things the customer wants the product to be able to do</li>
    <li>Phrased in the user's terms, not the developer's
      <ul>
      <li>E.g., &quot;visualize the similarity between the specified protein and the best 10 matches in the database&quot;</li>
      </ul>

    <li>Updated and re-prioritized by product owner at the start of each sprint</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sprint goal
    <ul>
    <li>(Very) brief description of what value this sprint is going to deliver</li>
    <li>E.g., &quot;Extend the program's visualization capabilities&quot;</li>
    <li>Every activity is measured against this</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sprint backlog
    <ul>
    <li>The subset of the product backlog to be done in this sprint</li>
    <li>Estimates for work remaining on each task are updated daily</li>
    <li>&quot;What should be in the backlog for the next sprint?&quot; is often an item</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Burndown chart
    <ul>
    <li>Shows work remaining per item vs. elapsed time</li>
    <li>Not necessarily monotonically decreasing: sometimes work will uncover more work</li>
    <li>The best predictor of when something will actually be finished</li>

  <h2>15) Step 1: Gathering Requirements</h2>
  <ul>

    <ul>
    <li>Boehm's Curve again: building the wrong thing is the most expensive mistake you can make</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Start by asking what problem the software is supposed to solve
    <ul>
    <li>What do you want to be able to do that you can't right now?</li>
    <li>What does the existing software do that you don't want it to?</li>
    <li>What does it make you do that you don't want to?</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Good requirements are complete and unambiguous
    <ul>
    <li>&quot;The system will reformat data files as they are submitted&quot; is neither</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Instead:
    <ul>
    <li>Only users who have logged in by providing a valid user name and password can upload files</li>
    <li>The system must allow users to upload files via a secure web form</li>
    <li>The system must accept files up to 16MB in size</li>
    <li>The system must accept files in PDB and RJCS-1 format</li>
    <li>The system must convert files to RJCS-2 format before storing them</li>
    <li>The system must present users with an error message page if an uploaded file cannot be parsed</li>
    <li>Etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A contract amongst the various stakeholders
    <ul>
    <li>Overly formal for two-person research prototypes</li>

  <h2>17) Step 2: From Requirements to Features</h2>
  <ul>

  <h2>21) Where Estimates Come From</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Time estimates come from experience
    <ul>
    <li>You should be able to guess how much code you'll have to write to implement something</li>
    <li>If you can't, you should think it through in more detail, or write some more throwaway code</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Keep track of how long it takes your team to build things
    <ul>
    <li>Just as athletes track their times for the 1000 meters, or how much they can bench press</li>
    <li>The most extreme version of this is Humphrey's <a href="{{root_path}}/book/glossary.html#personal-software-process" target="glo:personal-software-process">Personal Software Process (PSP)</a> <a href="bib.html#bib:humphrey-psp" target="bib:humphrey-psp">[Humphrey 1996]</a></li>

  <li>Remember to include time for testing, debugging, and documenting
    <ul>
    <li>Based on average developers and average days, not the best and their best</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Your first estimates will be far too optimistic

  <li>References to other A&amp;Es, URLs, pointers to prototypes in the repository, etc.</li>

  <li>Only big choice remaining is whether to do big items first, or little ones</li>

    <li>Remember to take dependencies into account</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>End result is a list of who's doing what, when
    <ul>
    <li>Schedule people at 80% of capacity to allow for sick time, interruptions, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Yes, it contains a lot of guesswork...

  <h2>27) Science Fiction Scheduling</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Do <em>not</em> shave time estimates to make them fit

    <li>...or supplying random numbers, secure in the knowledge that they won't be able make the deadline anyway</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Making up &quot;science fiction schedules&quot; is a very common mistake
    <ul>
    <li>Yes, people will complain if their feature doesn't make it onto the schedule</li>
    <li>But putting it in the schedule <em>when you know that schedule is fiction</em> won't make them any happier</li>

    <li>Every developer writes a few bullet points every week</li>
    <li>Doing this at 9:00 a.m. Monday works better than asking for it at 4:45 on Friday</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Describe tasks in terms of <a href="{{root_path}}/book/glossary.html#verifiable-deliverable" target="glo:verifiable-deliverable">verifiable deliverables</a>

    <li>Things that other people can inspect or test</li>

  <li>Always mark tasks as &quot;done&quot; or &quot;not done&quot;, rather than &quot;X% complete&quot;
    <ul>
    <li>If you allow percentages, then many tasks will be 90% done for 90% of the lifetime of the project</li>
    <li>Instead, break tasks down into subtasks that are at most a few days long, and either are or are not completed</li>

  <h2>31) Step 7: Finishing</h2>
  <ul>

  <li>If you're only starting to build the installer now, you've left it too late

    <li>Installation and upgrade code can be as complex as the application itself</li>
    <li>Do design, and budget time, when writing A&amp;E</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Do <em>not</em> ask for a &quot;big push&quot;
