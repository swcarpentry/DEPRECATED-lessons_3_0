  <h2>2) Bhargan Basepair</h2>

Bhargan Basepair received a B.Sc. in biochemistry five years ago.  He
has been working since then for Genes'R'Us, a biotech firm with labs
in four countries.  He did a Java programming course as a freshman,
and a bioinformatics course using Perl as a senior.

Bhargan and his colleagues are developing fuzzy pattern-matching
algorithms for finding similarities between DNA records in standard
databases.  To help other Genes'R'Us researchers, and to test his
group's heuristics, Bhargan runs an overnight sequence query service.
Researchers email sequences in a variety of formats (in-line,
attachments, URLs to pages behind the company firewall, etc.).
Bhargan saves them in files called <code>search/a.in</code>,
<code>search/b.in</code>, and so on, then edits them to add query
directives.  He is very conscientious, and almost never accidentally
overwrites one query with another.

Before leaving at night, he runs a Perl script that processses these
inputs to create output files with matching names like
<code>search/a.out</code>.  When Bhargan comes in the next morning, he pages
through his mail again, sending <code>.out</code> files to the appropriate
people.  (He almost never sends the wrong file to the wrong person.)
He then uses another Perl script to copy all the input and output
files to a directory with a name corresponding to the date, such as
<code>2009-07-23</code>.  He and his colleagues would like to do statistics
on these saved queries and results to see how well their algorithms
are doing, but have never found the time.

This course will teach Bhargan how to automate his overnight service
by writing simple scripts to retrieve, process, and reply to email
queries.  Those scripts will automatically record queries, results,
and other data, and produce a daily summary of the performance of the
pattern-matching algorithms.

  <h2>3) Helen Helmet</h2>

Helen Helmet, a Ph.D. student in mechanical engineering, is currently
doing a six-month internship at an engineering firm designing
carbon-fiber helmets for firefighters and other emergency service
personnel.  Her undergraduate courses included an introduction to
scientific computing using MATLAB, a robotics course using C, and a
numerical methods course that also used MATLAB.  She taught herself
Fortran during a co-op placement between her junior and senior years,
and used it again in a graduate course on finite elements.

Helen's task is to model the non-combustive thermal degradation
(otherwise known as &quot;melting&quot;) of candidate materials.  Her starting
point is a 14,000-line program her supervisor wrote a decade ago.
After deciding that there isn't time to re-write it in C++ (which she
would like to learn), she comments out the calls to the mesh
deformation routine in the main loop and begins to write a
replacement.  She sometimes deletes what she has written and starts
over three or four times before she is satisfied.

Helen tests her program by writing the total heat content of the mesh
at each time step to a file.  She then loads this data into MATLAB to
graph the percentage differences between these values and the ones
produced by the original program for six sample problems.  In one
case, the difference grew as large as 30% by the end of the
simulation.  Helen added <code>write</code> statements to her program to
display values until she managed to convince herself that the
difference was due to a bug in the original subroutines.

Helen keeps a to-do list on her home page.  Every two or three days,
she updates this list to show the progress she has made.  She keeps
completed tasks on the page until the end of the month, when she
writes a short status report for her supervisor.

This course will teach Helen to design software before she starts
typing, and that there are better ways to manage code evolution than
commenting out one section, and replacing it with another.  She will
also learn more effective testing and debugging procedures, and how to
use a version control system to ensure that she can back down to an
old version of code when she needs to.  Finally, she will be shown how
to use an issue-tracking system to manage her to-do list, and how to
write a small script to generate his monthly progress report
automatically.

  <h2>4) Stefan Synthesis</h2>

Stefan Synthesis is a graduate student in chemistry who is working as
a lab technician to help cover his costs.  His only programming
experience is a general first-year introduction to computational
science using Python.

Stefan's supervisor is studying the production of fullerenes (also
known as &quot;buckyballs&quot;).  Each set of experiments involves 100
different reactant mixtures, 20 different temperature regimes, and 5
different pressures.  Using a machine built by a collaborating lab,
Stefan can run all the mixture and temperature combinations at once,
so that the output of each experiment is five files containing 2000
lines of data each.

The controller for the experimental machine writes these files to
Stefan's workstation approximately an hour after the experiment
begins.  To analyze them, Stefan opens them with Excel, copies and
pastes to merge the data into one spreadsheet, then creates a chart
using the chart wizard.  He saves the chart as a PNG file on the
group's web site, along with the original data file.

Two or three times a week, Stefan receives results from his
supervisor's collaborators.  He creates charts for each, which he
uploads to the web site, then merges summary statistics into a master
spreadsheet.

This course will teach Stefan how to automate the process described
above.  More importantly, it will teach him how to track the
provenance of the data he is working with, so that scientists in his
group and others can trace backward from the final charts to the raw
data they represent.

  <h2>5) Self Assessment</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>1 for &quot;yes&quot;, 0 for &quot;no&quot; or &quot;not relevant&quot;, and -1 if you don't understand the question
    <ul>
    <li>Do you use version control?</li>
    <li>Can you rebuild everything with one command?</li>
    <li>Do you build the software from scratch daily?</li>
    <li>Do you have an automated test suite?</li>
    <li>Do you run the suite before checking in changes?</li>
    <li>Do you know how much code your tests cover?</li>
    <li>Do you have a bug database?</li>
    <li>Do you use a symbolic debugger?</li>
    <li>Do you use assertions and other defensive programming techniques?</li>
    <li>Can you trace <em>everything</em> you release (not just software) back to its origins?</li>
    <li>Do you document as you program?</li>
    <li>Do you keep your documentation in your source files?</li>
    <li>Can you set up a development environment on a fresh machine without heroic effort?</li>
    <li>Is there a searchable archive of discussions about the project?</li>
    <li>Do you use a style checker to ensure that your software is written in a uniform, readable way?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Your score:
    <ul>
    <li>Negative: you will find this course challenging, but rewarding</li>
    <li>0-5: this course will fill in the gaps in what you already know</li>
    <li>6-10: you will be able to apply the ideas in this course to your own projects immediately</li>
    <li>11 and up: you should probably go straight to the primary material in the bibliography</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>

<div class="topic">
  <h2>6) The State of Play</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Computers are as important to scientists as telescopes and test tubes
    <ul>
    <li>Simulate things that are too big, too small, too fast, too slow, or too dangerous to study in the lab</li>
    <li>Analyze volumes of data that would overwhelm human &quot;computers&quot;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Many scientists now spend much of their time writing and maintaining software</li>
  <li>But most have never been taught how to do this efficiently
    <ul>
    <li>It's a long way from the loops and arrays of first year to simulating bone development in fetal marsupials</li>
    <li>Like being shown how to differentiate polynomials, then expected to invent the rest of calculus</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>As a result, scientists spend far more time programming than they ought to
    <ul>
    <li>And they still don't know how trustworthy their programs are</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="topic">
  <h2>7) Meeting Standards</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Experimental results are only publishable if they are believed to be <em>correct</em> and <em>reproducible</em>
    <ul>
    <li>Equipment calibrated, samples uncontaminated, relevant steps recorded, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In practice, rely on expectations and cultural norms
    <ul>
    <li>Drilled into people starting with their first high school chemistry class</li>
    <li>Only actually check work that is already under suspicion</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How well do computational scientists meet these standards?
    <ul>
    <li>Correctness of code rarely questioned
      <ul>
      <li>We all know programs are buggy...</li>
      <li>...but when was the last time you saw a paper rejected because of concerns over software quality?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Reproducibility often nonexistent
      <ul>
      <li>How many people can reproduce, much less trace, each computational result in their thesis?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>

<div class="topic">
  <h2>8) The Grass Isn't That Much Greener</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>The bad news is that things aren't that much better in industry
    <ul>
    <li>Commercial projects of all sizes routinely go over time and over budget</li>
    <li>What they deliver is often incomplete, riddled with bugs, and not what the customer actually wanted</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How is this possible?
    <ul>
    <li>Low expectations
      <ul>
      <li>Like American cars in the 1970s</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Lack of accountability
      <ul>
      <li>Hard to sue software developers</li>
      <li>Most shrink-wrap licenses effectively say, &quot;This CD could be blank, and we wouldn't have to give you back your money.&quot;</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>

<div class="topic">
  <h2>9) Hidden in Plain Sight</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>The good news is that we've had solutions for these problems for years
    <ul>
    <li>They just aren't evenly distributed</li>
    <li>This is one of the reasons good programmers are up to 28 times better than bad ones <a href="bib.html#bib:glass-facts-fallacies" target="bib:glass-facts-fallacies">[Glass 2002]</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Improving quality improves productivity</em>
    <ul>
    <li>The more effort you put into making sure it's right the first time, the less total time it'll take to get it built</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>The tools and techniques that help you write better code also help you write more code, faster</em>
    <ul>
    <li>Version control</li>
    <li>Test-driven development</li>
    <li>Task automation</li>
    <li>Symbolic debuggers</li>
    <li>And more that we'll meet later</li>

  </ul>

<div class="topic">
  <h2>10) The Times They Are A-Changing</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>The current situation is clearly unstable
    <ul>
    <li>The only direction standards and expectations can go is up</li>
    <li>One high-profile lawsuit could set a precedent for the whole industry</li>
    <li>Change can happen almost overnight
      <ul>
      <li>Like the American car market when German and Japanese imports appeared in the 1970s</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Offshoring is currently the biggest pressure
    <ul>
    <li>Jobs that <em>can</em> move overseas <em>will</em></li>
    <li>As in manufacturing, only work that adds significant value will remain</li>
    <li>Which means that programmers in affluent societies either move up, or move out</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This course is just as relevant if you're in Mexico, India, China, or Hungary
    <ul>
    <li>&quot;Ship, then fix&quot; doesn't work if you're eleven time zones away from the customer</li>
    <li>Your chances of getting a second project are much better if you deliver the first one on spec and on time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="topic">
  <h2>11) This Course</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Introduce some basic tools
    <ul>
    <li>Instant gratification</li>
    <li>Serve as a guide to good practice
      <ul>
      <li>Every software tool implicitly embodies someone's ideas about how a task should be done</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Show how to build tools like these
    <ul>
    <li>What goes into the software</li>
    <li>How to create it</li>
    <li>Don't expect you to write your own version control system or bug tracker
      <ul>
      <li>But <em>do</em> expect you to automate common tasks, make your products extensible, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Show how to apply these ideas to other tasks
    <ul>
    <li>Most modern well-engineered applications are implemented as specialized sets of tools</li>
    <li>(Where &quot;well-engineered&quot; means flexible, reliable, and maintainable)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Keep in mind that it's impossible to cram an undergraduate degree and several years of industry experience into one course
    <ul>
    <li>If you really want to improve, you have to treat this course as a starter's block, not a finishing line</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>12) Setting Up</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Some previous programming experience
    <ul>
    <li><code>for</code> loops, <code>if</code>/<code>then</code>/<code>else</code>, ...</li>
    <li>Function calls, arrays, file I/O, ...</li>

    <li><a href="bib.html#bib:python" target="bib:python">[Python]</a> (version 2.3 or higher)
      <ul>
      <li>We'll look at why later</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A Unix shell
      <ul>
      <li>Use <a href="bib.html#bib:cygwin" target="bib:cygwin">[Cygwin]</a> if you're on Windows</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>An editor (preferably one with syntax highlighting and macros)

  <h2>13) A Note on Tool Choice</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Most of the tools used in this course are freely available under various open source licenses
    <ul>
    <li>As are these notes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>That <em>doesn't</em> mean that free tools are always best
    <ul>
    <li><em>Linux is only free if your time has no value.</em> (Jamie Zawinski)</li>
    <li>Commercial tools are often more complete than their free counterparts
      <ul>
      <li>Not least because there are some jobs people will only do if they're paid to</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If you're willing to spend $200 on a good chair, you should be willing to spend $200 on software, too</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you want to use open source software:
    <ul>
    <li>Be aware that many companies provide for-pay technical support</li>
    <li>Read <a href="bib.html#bib:fogel-producing-open-source" target="bib:fogel-producing-open-source">[Fogel 2005]</a> (and possibly <a href="bib.html#bib:rosen-open-source-licensing" target="bib:rosen-open-source-licensing">[Rosen 2005]</a>)</li>
    <li>Think about contributing something yourself
      <ul>
      <li>Great way to make contacts and learn new skills</li>
      <li>Best way to get exactly what you want</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
